C4: More control flow tools
If you need to modify the sequence you are iterating over while inside the loop (for example to duplicate selected items), it is recommended that you first make a copy. Slice makes it easy.

for w in words[:]:  # Loop over a slice copy of the entire list.
...     if len(w) > 6:
...         words.insert(0, w)
...

range functions takes negative step value as well.
Break like C breaks out of innermost enclosing for OR while loop.

Loop statements may have an else clause; it is executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion of the list (with for) or when the condition becomes false (with while), but not when the loop is terminated by a break statement

The pass statement does nothing(Seriously!). Commonly used for creating minimal classes OR as a placeholder for a function or condtional body when working on new code.

The keyword def introduces a function definition.
  The first statement of function body can be string literal aka docstring. There are tools! which use docstrings to automatically produce online or printed documentation, or let the user interactively browse through the code. 

The execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local variables of the function. More precisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local symbol table; whereas variable references first look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in the table of built-in names. Thus, global variables cannot be directly assigned a value within a function (unless named in a global statement), although they may be referenced.

When a function calls another function, a new local symbol table is created for that call.
Actually, call by object reference would be a better description, since if a mutable object is passed, the caller will see any changes the callee makes to it (items inserted into a list).

A function definition introduces the function name in the current symbol table. The value of the function name has a type that is recognized by the interpreter as a user-defined function. This value can be assigned to another name which can then also be used as a function. This serves as a general renaming mechanism.

In fact, even functions without a return statement do return a value, albeit a rather boring one. This value is called None (it’s a built-in name).

A method is a function that 'belongs' to an object and is named obj.methodname .
Note: list.append(a) is more efficient than list = list + [a] .

Defining functions with variable number of arguments:
1. Default argument values 

The most useful form is to specify a default value for one or more arguments
   def ask_ok(prompt, retries=4, complaint='Yes or no, please!'):
Note: Not sure if you can selectively give values for default arguments on the right before giving values for all default arguments on the left. Same as C/C++ problem?

The default values are evaluated at the point of function definition in the defining scope, so that

i = 5

def f(arg=i):
    print arg

i = 6
f()
will print 5.

Important warning: The default value is evaluated only once. Makes a difference when the default is a mutable object. eg:
def f(a, L=[]):
    L.append(a)
    return L

print f(1)
print f(2)
print f(3)
This will print

[1]
[1, 2]
[1, 2, 3]
If you don’t want the default to be shared between subsequent calls, you can write the function like this instead:

def f(a, L=None):
    if L is None:
        L = []
    L.append(a)
    return L

2. Keyword arguments

In a function call, keyword arguments must follow positional arguments.
All the keyword arguments must match of the arguments accepted by the function and their order is not important.
No argument may receive a value more than once.

When a final formal parameter of the form **name is present, it receives a dictionary (see Mapping Types — dict) containing all keyword arguments except for those corresponding to a formal parameter. This may be combined with a formal parameter of the form *name (described in the next subsection) which receives a tuple containing the positional arguments beyond the formal parameter list. (*name must occur before **name.). See example in: https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#id2

3. Arbitrary arguments lists

Finally, the least frequently used option is to specify that a function can be called with an arbitrary number of arguments. These arguments will be wrapped up in a tuple (see Tuples and Sequences). Before the variable number of arguments, zero or more normal arguments may occur.

4.7.4 Unpacking Argument Lists
write the function call with the *-operator to unpack the arguments out of a list or tuple

args = [3, 6]
>>> range(*args)            # call with arguments unpacked from a list
[3, 4, 5]

In the same fashion, dictionaries can deliver keyword arguments with the **-operator.

4.7.5 Lambda Expressions
Small anonymous functions can be created with lambda keyword.

1. Used as function objects. Use case to return  a function.

def make_incrementor(n):
...     return lambda x: x + n
...
>>> f = make_incrementor(42)
>>> f(0)
42
>>> f(1)
43

2. Pass function as an argument.

>>> pairs = [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three'), (4, 'four')]
>>> pairs.sort(key=lambda pair: pair[1])
>>> pairs
[(4, 'four'), (1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two')]

C5: Data Structures

5.1 Useful list functions.
list.extend(L) 
list.insert(i,x)
list.remove(x)
list.pop([i]): Removes last if no element specified.
list.index(x)
list.count(x)
list.sort(...)  //Read in detail
list.reverse()

Method that only modify the list have None return type. This is a design principle for all mutable data structures in python.

Use lists as stacks with append and pop.
Use lists as queue with append and pop(0). Note: Lists are not efficient fot this. While appends and pops from the end of the list are fast, doing inserts or pops from the beginning of a list is slow. 
Instead use collections.deque designed to have fast appends and pops from both ends.

5.1.3 Functional programming tools
There are 3 built in functions very useful with lists. 
1. Filter
filter(function,sequence) returns sequence items where function(item) is true

def f(x): return x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0
...
>>> filter(f, range(2, 25))
[3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 21, 24]

2. Map 
map(function,sequence) returns sequence of items post applying function on them

def cube(x): return x*x*x
...
>>> map(cube, range(1, 11))
[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]

3. Reduce
reduce(function,sequence) returns a single value constructed by calling the binary function on the first two sequence items, then on the result and next item, and so on. 

def add(x,y): return x+y
...
>>> reduce(add, range(1, 11))
55

Some additional nuances mentioned in the tutorial.

4. Zip

zip function:
>>> x = [1, 2, 3]
>>> y = [4, 5, 6]
>>> zipped = zip(x, y)
>>> zipped
[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
>>> x2, y2 = zip(*zipped)
>>> x == list(x2) and y == list(y2)
True

zip with * operand unzips a list.

5.1.4 List Comprehensions(Extremely powerful)
- Provide a concise way to create lists.
- Common application is to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.

A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses 

squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

[(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y]
Output:[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]

5.1.4.1 Nested List Comprehensions
Nested list comprehension is evaluated in the context of the for that follows it.

>>> matrix = [
...     [1, 2, 3, 4],
...     [5, 6, 7, 8],
...     [9, 10, 11, 12],
... ]

>>> [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(4)]
[[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]

5.2 The del statement
Used to delete an item from a list given its index.
Can also be used to remove slices from a list.
a
[1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5]
>>> del a[2:4]
>>> a
[1, 66.25, 1234.5]

5.3 Tuples and Sequences
Sequence data types covered so far: string and lists. Support indexing and slicing.

A tuple consists of a number of values seperated by commas.
t = 12345,54321,"hello!"

Tuples are immutable.
But they can contain mutable objects.

v = ([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])
>>> v
([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])

On output, tuples are always enclosed in parantheses so that nested tuples are interpreted correctly. 

Look similar to lists but used differently.

List                            //    Tuples
Mutable                         //    Immutable
Homogeneous elements            //    Hetrogeneous sequence of elements
Iterating over the list.        //    Accessed via unpacking,indexing,attribute.

Quirks: Construction of tuple with 0,1 element
empty = ()
singleton = "hello",    #note the trailing comma

Concept of tuple packing:
t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!' 
Concept of tuple unpacking
>>> x, y, z = t

Called sequence unpacking and works for any sequence on the right. The number of variables on the left must
be equal to the length of the sequence on the right.

5.4 Sets
Unordered collection with no duplicate elements.

Uses: Membership testing and elimination duplicate entries.
Also support ops like union,intersection, difference and symmetric difference.

>>> a - b                              # letters in a but not in b
>>> a | b                              # letters in either a or b
>>> a & b                              # letters in both a and b
>>> a ^ b                              # letters in a or b but not both

Just like list comprehensions, set comprehensions also exist.

5.5 Dictionaries
Dictionary keys can be any immutable type. 

String and numbers can be keys.
Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings,numbers or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key.
You cannot use lists as keys.

Dictionary is unordered set of key:value pairs. [Keys are unique within one dictionary]
A pair of braces {} creates empty dictionary.

In addition to storing/retrieving, you can also delete a key:value pair with del.

dictionary.keys() returns list of all keys used in the dictionary. 
To check in key in dictionary, use in keyword.

The dict constructor builds dictionaries directly from sequence of key:value pairs.
>>> dict([('sape', 4139), ('guido', 4127), ('jack', 4098)])
{'sape': 4139, 'jack': 4098, 'guido': 4127}

Dict comprehensions can be used.
>>> {x: x**2 for x in (2, 4, 6)}
{2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36}

When keys are strings:
>>> dict(sape=4139, guido=4127, jack=4098)
{'sape': 4139, 'jack': 4098, 'guido': 4127}

5.6 Looping Techniques
Looping through sequnce to get both index and value: use enumerate()

for i, v in enumerate(['tic', 'tac', 'toe']):
...     print i, v
...
0 tic
1 tac
2 toe

Combine with zip() to make it fancy:
>>> questions = ['name', 'quest', 'favorite color']
>>> answers = ['lancelot', 'the holy grail', 'blue']
>>> for q, a in zip(questions, answers):
...     print 'What is your {0}?  It is {1}.'.format(q, a)
...
What is your name?  It is lancelot.

Use reversed() to reverse a sequence.
sorted() returns a new sorted list leaving the source unaltered.

For dictionaries, key,value pair get together using iteritems()
>>> for k, v in knights.iteritems():
...     print k, v

5.7 More on Conditions

in and not in check whether value occurs/not occurs.
is and is not compare whether two object are the same/not the same
Comparision operators have lower priority than numerical operators.
Boolean operators have lower priority than comparison operators.

and/or are short circuit evaluated left to right.

Unlike C, assigment cannot occur inside expressions.

5.8 Comparing sequences

(1, 2, 3)              < (1, 2, 4)
[1, 2, 3]              < [1, 2, 4]
'ABC' < 'C' < 'Pascal' < 'Python'
(1, 2, 3, 4)           < (1, 2, 4)
(1, 2)                 < (1, 2, -1)
(1, 2, 3)             == (1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
(1, 2, ('aa', 'ab'))   < (1, 2, ('abc', 'a'), 4) 

Note that comparing object of different types is legal but arbitrary.
The types are ordered by name:
Thus, a list is always smaller than a string, a string is always smaller than a tuple. (This may change with new python versions).
